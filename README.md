In this repo you'll find code for a clock I made using ESP32 moduele
All the libraries used can be found in 'libraries' directory
Please use the libraries I have provided as I've made changes TPClient library to include date as well
Apart from this you'll also need to add ESP32 board by Espressif Systems.
